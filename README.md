# Cathay_Hackathon_2024

## Overview
Enhanced Vera is designed to be more than just a travel chatbot; itâ€™s a lifestyle assistant that supports Cathay members in their daily routines and travel plans. By delivering highly personalized recommendations, Vera will transform interactions into meaningful engagements, anticipating needs and preferences to make every interaction smooth and intuitive. Our goal is to create an AI-driven experience that feels tailored and genuine, supporting a range of activities from travel bookings to lifestyle recommendations, seamlessly integrated with Asia Miles partners.
